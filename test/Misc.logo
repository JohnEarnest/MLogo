# I had an amusing bug in which procedure bodies
# containing only a call to one primitive were
# confused with the primitive body itself by
# the TCO mechanism, leading to infinite loops:

to foo
	trace
end

to bar
	trace
	run [foo]
end
bar


# a procedure which makes use of 'implicit output':

to implicit :x
	sum 45 :x
end

print implicit 5

# does implicit output also work if you just have a bare literal?

to bareimplicit
	999
end

print bareimplicit

# does implict output work if you chain procedures?

to outer
	print implicit 666
end
outer

# does implicit output work when 'running' a passed in literal?
